GSL license (The god-source license) 

This creation is freely given to everyone without restriction on use while 
    respectfully giving attribution to a higher power that instills ideas 
    making this creation possible.
        (1) I recognize that ideas popping in my head come from 'somewhere'.  
        (2) I generalize this 'somewhere' as a god-source abstraction to respect
              the personal beliefs of all that accept and use this license 
              [Under the Abrahamic tradition, many will refer to the source 
              as God or Allah, but others may refer to the source by other 
              names:  Obatala, Orunmila, Beher, Thoth, Enki, Brahma, Ganash,
              Pangu, Fuxi, Kvasir, Itzamna, Tupa, Hephaestus  ... 
              even others may refer to a non-god source such as 
              'information processing based on the chemistry and biology 
              of synapses firing in the brain'.;        
       (3) I pay homage to this god-source abstraction for the ideas.
